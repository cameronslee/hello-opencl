Steps for program

1) Obtain OpenCL platform
2) Obtain device id for at least one device (accelerator)
3) Create context for device
4) create accelerator program from source code 
5) build program 
6) create kernel(s) from program functions
7) create command queue for target device
8) allocate device memory / move input data to device memory
9) associate args to kernel with kernel obj
10) deploy kernel for device execution
11) move output data to host memory
12) release context/program/kernels/memory
